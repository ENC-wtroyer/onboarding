   - User acceptance testing

3. Documentation Completion (5 days)
   - System documentation finalization
   - Process documentation
   - Training material creation
   - Handover documentation

## Critical Dependencies

1. Network infrastructure must be operational before server deployment
2. Core infrastructure must be complete before application deployment
3. Security measures should be in place before user access is granted
4. Backup systems should be operational before production data is stored
5. DR should be tested before system goes live

## Timeline Flexibility

- Minimum Timeline: 8 weeks (requires aggressive parallelization)
- Recommended Timeline: 10-12 weeks
- Conservative Timeline: 12-14 weeks (includes buffer for issues)

## Risk Factors That May Impact Timeline

1. Hardware delivery delays
2. Vendor response times
3. Change control requirements
4. Resource availability
5. Legacy system migration complications
6. Security compliance requirements

## Success Criteria

1. All systems operational and tested
2. Documentation complete and verified
3. Security controls validated
4. Backup and DR tested
5. User acceptance sign-off received
6. Performance metrics met
